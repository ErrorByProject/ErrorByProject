### A little bit about me:

I started my programming journey with C++ in my highschool, since then I was hooked to programming and never gave up on improving, since I liked programming I decided to move out from my own country Lithuania and came to Denmark to study Software engineering, currently I am learning java programming language in my 1st semester.
